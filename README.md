## 🎓 Pass Probability Algorithm

The app uses a sophisticated algorithm to predict your likelihood of passing the ANCC PMHNP exam based on:

1. **Current Accuracy Rate** - Your percentage of correct answers
2. **Question Completion Rate** - How many questions you've practiced
3. **Practice Exam Performance** - Scores on full-length exams
4. **Category Performance** - Performance across different topics
5. **Study Consistency** - Regular study patterns
6. **Time Spent Studying** - Total study hours

### Probability Ranges:
- **90-100%**: Excellent - Very high likelihood of passing
- **85-89%**: Great - High probability of passing
- **75-84%**: Good - Moderate probability, continue studying
- **65-74%**: Fair - More practice needed
- **<65%**: Focus on weak areas, significant study required

**Note:** This predictor is based on historical performance data from test takers who used similar brain dump materials and should be used as a study guide, not a guarantee.
