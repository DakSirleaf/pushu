  2: "VALPROATE DRUG INTERACTION WITH LAMOTRIGINE: Valproate INHIBITS lamotrigine metabolism, DOUBLING lamotrigine levels. This significantly increases risk of STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME (SJS). When adding lamotrigine to valproate: start at 25mg every OTHER day (not daily), titrate half as fast. Conversely, carbamazepine (CYP inducer) decreases lamotrigine levels - may need higher lamotrigine doses. Board pearl: Lamotrigine-valproate interaction is heavily tested - always ask about concurrent valproate before starting lamotrigine.",

  3: "ANTIPSYCHOTIC METABOLIC MONITORING: All second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) require metabolic monitoring due to risk of metabolic syndrome. Highest risk: Olanzapine, clozapine. Moderate risk: Quetiapine, risperidone. Lower risk: Aripiprazole, ziprasidone, lurasidone. Monitor at baseline, 12 weeks, then annually: weight/BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, lipid panel, blood pressure. If diabetes develops, consider switching to lower-risk agent. Board pearl: 'Metabolic syndrome = increased waist + 2 of: high triglycerides, low HDL, hypertension, hyperglycemia.'",

  5: "LITHIUM MONITORING SCHEDULE: Baseline: renal function (BUN, creatinine), thyroid (TSH), ECG (if cardiac history), pregnancy test, CBC. Levels: Check 5-7 days after initiation or dose change (steady state), draw trough 12 hours post-dose. Maintenance: lithium level, renal function, TSH every 3-6 months when stable. More frequent if: dose change, new interacting medication, symptoms of toxicity, illness with vomiting/diarrhea. Board pearl: Lithium has narrow therapeutic index - close monitoring is essential.",

  7: "CLOZAPINE ANC MONITORING SCHEDULE (REMS): General population: ANC must be ≥1500/μL to start, ≥1500 to continue. Weekly ANC x 6 months → Biweekly x 6 months → Monthly thereafter if stable. If ANC 1000-1499: increase monitoring to 3x/week, may continue clozapine. If ANC <1000: STOP clozapine immediately (moderate neutropenia). If ANC <500: STOP and do NOT rechallenge (severe neutropenia). Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN): lower thresholds apply. Board pearl: Agranulocytosis risk is ~1%, highest in first 6 months.",

  9: "LITHIUM TOXICITY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: Mild toxicity (1.5-2.0 mEq/L): nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fine tremor worsening to coarse tremor, lethargy. Moderate toxicity (2.0-2.5 mEq/L): confusion, ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, fasciculations. Severe toxicity (>2.5 mEq/L): seizures, coma, cardiovascular collapse, death. Management: stop lithium, IV fluids for hydration, hemodialysis if severe (level >4.0 or neurological symptoms). Board pearl: Early signs are GI (nausea, diarrhea) and neurological (tremor, ataxia) - teach patients to recognize these.",

  11: "SSRI DISCONTINUATION SYNDROME: Abrupt SSRI cessation can cause discontinuation symptoms, especially with SHORT half-life agents (paroxetine, venlafaxine worst; fluoxetine rarely due to long half-life). Symptoms: dizziness, nausea, flu-like symptoms, insomnia, 'brain zaps' (electric shock sensations), irritability. Onset 1-3 days after stopping. Prevention: gradual taper over 2-4 weeks. Treatment: restart SSRI and taper more slowly, or switch to fluoxetine (self-tapers due to long half-life). Board pearl: Paroxetine has highest discontinuation syndrome risk; fluoxetine has lowest.",

  12: "SSRI BLACK BOX WARNING: FDA black box warning for increased suicidality in CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, and YOUNG ADULTS (18-24) during initial treatment. Monitoring required: weekly x 4 weeks, then biweekly x 4 weeks, then at 12 weeks and as indicated. This does NOT mean SSRIs are contraindicated in youth - benefits often outweigh risks for moderate-severe depression. Untreated depression also increases suicide risk. Discuss warning with patient/family. Board pearl: Black box applies to ages <25; monitor closely especially in first 1-2 months.",

  13: "TRAZODONE USES AND CAUTIONS: Primarily used as sleep aid at low doses (25-100mg) due to H1 and 5-HT2A blockade. Higher doses (150-400mg) for depression (SARI mechanism). PRIAPISM is rare but serious side effect (prolonged erection >4 hours = medical emergency). Orthostatic hypotension risk, especially in elderly. Rarely used as primary antidepressant now. No significant CYP interactions. Board pearl: Trazodone is the most commonly prescribed medication for insomnia in psychiatric patients.",

  16: "VENLAFAXINE (Effexor) DOSE-DEPENDENT MECHANISM: At low doses (<150mg), primarily serotonergic (similar to SSRI). At moderate doses (150-225mg), adds norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. At high doses (>225mg), may add dopamine effects. Side effects: nausea (most common), discontinuation syndrome (worst of SNRIs - short half-life), dose-dependent hypertension (monitor BP at higher doses), sexual dysfunction. Venlafaxine XR preferred over IR for adherence. Board pearl: Check blood pressure when titrating venlafaxine above 225mg.",

  21: "TCA TOXICITY AND OVERDOSE: Tricyclic antidepressants have narrow therapeutic index - lethal in overdose (2-week supply can be fatal). Cardiac toxicity: QRS widening, arrhythmias. Anticholinergic toxicity: hyperthermia, urinary retention, ileus, delirium. Seizures. Treatment: sodium bicarbonate for QRS >100ms, supportive care, activated charcoal if early. TCAs rarely first-line due to lethality in overdose and side effects. Still used for: neuropathic pain, migraine prophylaxis, treatment-resistant depression. Board pearl: Never prescribe more than 1-week supply of TCA to suicidal patient.",

  22: "TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT SIDE EFFECTS (remember: 'A TCA has side effects in THREES'): Anticholinergic (3): dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention. Cardiac (3): orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias. CNS (3): sedation, seizures (lower threshold), weight gain. Most anticholinergic: amitriptyline. Least anticholinergic: desipramine, nortriptyline. TCAs contraindicated: recent MI, heart block, narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention. Board pearl: Nortriptyline has best side effect profile among TCAs - often preferred when TCA needed.",

  23: "MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (MAOIs) - TYPES: Irreversible, non-selective: phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate) - require tyramine diet restrictions. Irreversible, selective MAO-B: selegiline oral (Parkinson's) - at low doses MAO-B selective, minimal diet restrictions. Transdermal selegiline (Emsam): at 6mg/24hr, minimal systemic absorption - no dietary restrictions at this dose; higher doses need diet restrictions. Reversible MAO-A: moclobemide (not US). Board pearl: Selegiline patch 6mg requires no dietary restrictions - unique among MAOIs.",

  25: "ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC SELECTION BY SIDE EFFECT PROFILE: High metabolic risk (weight, glucose, lipids): olanzapine, clozapine. Moderate metabolic: quetiapine, risperidone. Lower metabolic: aripiprazole, ziprasidone, lurasidone. High sedation: olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine. Low sedation: aripiprazole, ziprasidone. High prolactin: risperidone, paliperidone. Low prolactin: aripiprazole (partial agonist). QTc risk: ziprasidone highest. EPS risk: risperidone > others (closer to typicals). Board pearl: Match antipsychotic to patient - consider weight, sedation needs, metabolic risk.",

  30: "ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED HYPERPROLACTINEMIA: Dopamine normally inhibits prolactin release. D2 blockade → prolactin elevation. Highest risk: risperidone, paliperidone (strong D2 binding). Symptoms: women - amenorrhea, galactorrhea, sexual dysfunction; men - gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction; both - osteoporosis long-term. Management: switch to prolactin-sparing agent (aripiprazole is partial D2 agonist, can lower prolactin), or add aripiprazole. Check prolactin if symptomatic. Board pearl: Aripiprazole can be added to reduce prolactin elevation from other antipsychotics.",

  31: "ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED WEIGHT GAIN MANAGEMENT: Prevention is key - counsel on diet/exercise before starting. Highest weight gain: olanzapine (average 4-7 kg in first year), clozapine. If significant weight gain occurs: switch to lower-risk agent if clinically feasible, consider metformin addition (evidence for reducing weight gain), lifestyle intervention. Monitor: weight monthly x 3 months, then quarterly. BMI increase >1 unit warrants intervention. Board pearl: Metabolic effects are the main reason patients discontinue antipsychotics - address proactively.",

  39: "ACUTE DYSTONIA TREATMENT: Acute dystonia = sustained muscle contractions occurring HOURS TO DAYS after starting antipsychotic. Common sites: neck (torticollis), jaw (trismus), eyes (oculogyric crisis), back (opisthotonus). Can be frightening and painful. Treatment: IM BENZTROPINE (Cogentin) 1-2mg or IM DIPHENHYDRAMINE 25-50mg - relief within minutes. Follow with oral anticholinergic x 48-72 hours. Prevention: anticholinergic prophylaxis for high-risk patients (young males, high-potency typical antipsychotics). Board pearl: Young male + high-potency typical = highest acute dystonia risk.",

  41: "AKATHISIA RECOGNITION AND TREATMENT: Akathisia = subjective inner restlessness + objective motor restlessness (pacing, inability to sit still, rocking). Onset: days to weeks after starting/increasing antipsychotic. Often MISDIAGNOSED as anxiety or agitation - if antipsychotic increased, akathisia worsens (vicious cycle). Associated with SUICIDAL IDEATION - take seriously. Treatment: reduce antipsychotic dose, switch agents, add PROPRANOLOL (first-line, 30-120mg/day), benzodiazepine, or mirtazapine. Board pearl: Always ask about akathisia when patient on antipsychotic reports anxiety or restlessness.",

  48: "SCREENING TOOLS COMPARISON - DEPRESSION: PHQ-9: 9 items, self-administered, maps to DSM criteria, scores 0-27, cutoff 10 for moderate depression. PHQ-2: first 2 questions (anhedonia, mood), screening only, if positive do full PHQ-9. BDI-II: 21 items, more comprehensive, used more in research. HAM-D: clinician-administered, 17 or 21 items, used to measure treatment response in trials. GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale): 15 or 30 items, designed for elderly, yes/no format, avoids somatic symptoms. Board pearl: PHQ-9 is most commonly used in primary care/psych practice.",

  49: "SCREENING TOOLS - ALCOHOL USE: AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test): 10 items, score ≥8 suggests hazardous drinking, ≥15-20 suggests dependence. AUDIT-C: first 3 questions only, quick screen. CAGE: 4 yes/no questions (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener) - ≥2 positive = likely problem drinking. Brief screen: 'How many times in past year have you had 5+ drinks (men) or 4+ drinks (women)?' SBIRT: Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment framework. Board pearl: CAGE is quick but misses hazardous drinking; AUDIT is more sensitive.",

  52: "ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL TREATMENT PROTOCOL: Assess severity with CIWA-Ar. Thiamine 100mg IV/IM BEFORE glucose (prevent Wernicke's). Benzodiazepines: symptom-triggered (CIWA-based) dosing is preferred. Common protocols: Chlordiazepoxide (long-acting, less abuse potential), Lorazepam (hepatic impairment), Diazepam (rapid onset, long-acting). CIWA ≥10: consider benzos. CIWA ≥20: high risk for seizures/DTs, ICU consideration. Adjuncts: IV fluids, electrolyte replacement, folate. Monitor: vital signs, CIWA q1-4h based on severity. Board pearl: Symptom-triggered dosing reduces total benzo dose and duration.",

  53: "MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT (MAT) FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER: Three FDA-approved medications: (1) BUPRENORPHINE (partial mu agonist): office-based with waiver, ceiling effect = safer, must wait for withdrawal before starting. (2) METHADONE (full agonist): opioid treatment program only for addiction (daily observed dosing initially), no ceiling effect, can start anytime. (3) NALTREXONE (antagonist): blocks opioid effects, no abuse potential, must be opioid-free 7-10 days first (or precipitated withdrawal). XR-naltrexone monthly injection improves adherence. Board pearl: All three MAT options reduce overdose deaths and illicit opioid use.",

  55: "CLONIDINE FOR OPIOID WITHDRAWAL: Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist reduces sympathetic hyperactivity of opioid withdrawal. Helps with: anxiety, agitation, muscle aches, sweating, runny nose, cramping. Does NOT help with: cravings, insomnia. Dosing: 0.1-0.3mg TID, titrate to effect and blood pressure tolerance. Side effects: hypotension, sedation, dry mouth. Not a substitute for MAT - provides symptom relief only. Often combined with other symptomatic treatments (loperamide for diarrhea, NSAIDs for pain). Board pearl: Clonidine for withdrawal symptoms, but buprenorphine/methadone for treatment of the disorder.",

  59: "3-MONTH DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES: Motor - lifts head 45-90° when prone, hands open at rest, briefly holds objects placed in hand. Social - recognizes parents, social smile responsive. Language - coos, begins to laugh. Vision - follows 180°, begins to reach for objects. Red flags at 3 months: no social smile, not tracking, no head control, persistent fisting. These milestones inform developmental surveillance at well-child visits. Board pearl: Head control progresses: lifts head when prone (1-2 mo) → holds head steady when supported (3-4 mo) → no head lag when pulled to sit (5-6 mo).",

  60: "6-MONTH DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES: Motor - sits with support progressing to briefly without, rolls both ways, transfers objects hand to hand, raking grasp. Social - stranger anxiety begins (peaks 8-9 months), responds to name. Language - babbles (consonant sounds 'ba', 'da'). Cognitive - object permanence beginning (looks for dropped object). Red flags: no rolling, no reaching, not babbling, no reciprocal smiles. Board pearl: Stranger anxiety at 6-9 months is NORMAL developmental milestone, not pathology.",

  61: "12-MONTH DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES: Motor - pulls to stand, cruises (walks holding furniture), may take independent steps, pincer grasp (thumb-index). Language - first words (1-3 words with meaning), understands 'no', follows simple commands. Social - separation anxiety peaks (8-18 months), plays pat-a-cake, waves bye-bye. Cognitive - object permanence established. Red flags: no babbling, not responding to name, no gestures (pointing, waving), not standing. Board pearl: If not walking by 18 months, evaluate - most walk by 15 months.",

  62: "18-MONTH DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES: Motor - walks well independently, begins to run stiffly, stacks 2-4 blocks, scribbles. Language - 10-25 words, points to named body parts, follows 2-step commands. Social - parallel play, increased independence, temper tantrums common. Cognitive - uses objects appropriately (brush on hair). This is a key age for AUTISM SCREENING (M-CHAT). Red flags: no words, not pointing, no pretend play, regression in skills. Board pearl: M-CHAT screening for autism recommended at 18 and 24 months.",

  65: "PIAGET FORMAL OPERATIONAL STAGE (Age 11+): Can think ABSTRACTLY and HYPOTHETICALLY. Develops: propositional thinking, deductive reasoning, metacognition (thinking about thinking), considers possibilities/futures, idealistic thinking. Adolescents can now: solve abstract math problems, consider hypothetical situations, understand metaphor and irony, engage in moral reasoning about abstract principles. Not all adults fully achieve formal operations for all types of problems. Board pearl: Formal operations = abstract + hypothetical thinking - distinguishes from concrete operational.",

  73: "SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER DSM-5 CRITERIA: Marked fear of social situations where scrutiny by others is possible. Fear of acting in way that will be negatively evaluated (embarrassment, rejection). Social situations almost always provoke fear. Fear is out of proportion to actual threat. Duration ≥6 months. Significant distress or functional impairment. Specify: performance only (fear limited to public speaking/performance). Rule out: substance effects, medical condition, other mental disorders. Board pearl: Performance-only subtype responds well to PRN beta-blockers; generalized type needs daily SSRI + therapy.",

Note: media exposure doesn't count unless work-related. Then need symptoms in 4 clusters: intrusion, avoidance, negative cognitions/mood, arousal/reactivity. Duration >1 month. If <1 month = Acute Stress Disorder. Board pearl: PTSD requires life-threatening/sexual violence trauma - not all stressors qualify.",

  83: "ADJUSTMENT DISORDER DSM-5: Emotional or behavioral symptoms within 3 MONTHS of identifiable stressor. Marked distress out of proportion to stressor OR significant functional impairment. Does not meet criteria for another mental disorder. Not normal bereavement. Symptoms resolve within 6 MONTHS of stressor ending. Specify: with depressed mood, anxiety, mixed, disturbance of conduct, mixed disturbance. Treatment: primarily psychotherapy (supportive, brief dynamic, CBT); medications rarely needed.
